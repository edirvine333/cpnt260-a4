## NOTES  

1.  The design on this assignment kind of lead the way and because of the focus on the hero section, became desktop-first. Hence some of the design and layout choices. Inevitably, if it worked, I rolled with it.     
2.  The Google Map is interactive but not responsive.  I have sized it for an appropriate scroll track, and I got lost in learning the `position` property required by the code I found.  
3.  I found a validation error on the Formspree code that I used for the contact form.  
4.  To make the Purchase Tickets button a link, I used a code example from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). It uses the `onclick` attribute, and works perfectly on my desktop.  However, [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) lists this attribute as 17.41% browser compatability. I recognize I have made a design error by limiting my user base; however, I am leaving it for review.
