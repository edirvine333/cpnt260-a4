## NOTES  

1.  The design on this assignment kind of lead the way...  when something worked, I inevitably ended up rolling with it, but I am happy with the overall layout.  
2.  the Google Map is interactive but not responsive.  I have sized it for an appropriate scroll track, and got lost in learning the position: property required by the code I found.  

## ATTRIBUTIONS  


google is interactive but not responsive, so after researching responsiveness and having troubles, i sized it to allow for scroll tracks on a mobile nd to avoid getting "trapped" in the map scroll...

17.41% compatability, not operable on iOS Safari, ANdroid, Chrome for Android, FIrefox for Android, and many more.  This would habve been a poor choice, but I am leaving it with hopes of getting marks for my process of determingn the flaw...

mistake made was not properly starting mobile first, because i wanted a nice big hero desktop hero section...  i fouhgt with responsiveness because of this...
